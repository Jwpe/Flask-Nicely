What is Flask-Nicely?
=====================

Flask-Nicely consists of a simple decorator with which to wrap Flask
functions that return data in order to turn them into pretty, consistent
JSON responses. It also provides several built in HTTP exceptions which can
be raised in a Flask function in order to return the corresponding HTTP
error response.
